Files:

index.html
- For this file, I created an HTML file containing my name, a photo of me,
a link to my resume, and a link to my biography. I had to use links and images
with html to make this work. I also used style2.css to style my HTML file.

bio.html
- For this file, I created an HTML file with a little biography of my life
so far. I style it with style2.css. I used a border, background color, and 
some more style tools in CSS.

resume.html
- For this file, I created an HTML file with my resume. In this file I 
used style.css to style. I had information about my education,
professional experience, activities, and more.

style.css
-  In this file I had 7 rules. I included rules such as font-family
   font size, color, text-align, border-color/style and background color
   I used this style in my resume and bio

style2.css
-  In this file I had 5 rules similar to in style.css, but different
attributes.


I also created an index.html for my cs website at tufts so that it would 
redirect to my github.io page.
